    <h1>This is my hobby.</h1>

    <p>
        I am a software engineer with a fascination with biological systems.<br>
        In particular, I like modeling the behavior of those systems.

            This is essentially fixed 'adult' growth cones for both dendrites and axon, extending from point neurons, that get aligned<br>
            based on grooves cut into the culture base to align the neurons. This simulation has monodirectional alignment as opposed to
            the bidirectional alignment in the given paper
        </p>
        <p>
            Growth will eventually be replaced by growth cone dynamics based on neurotrophic and nutrient gradients.<br>
            However, the current approach was chosen to reduce computational complexity.

            The connection is probabilistic, where the area of overlap between one neuron's axonal cones and another neuron's dendritic cones<br>
            determines the probability of connection.
        </h5>
        <img src="./static/about/images/probabilistic-connection.png">
        <p>
            For the purposes of this demo, the area of alignment necessary for the probability to reach 1 is arbitrarily small.
        </p>

            The geometric properties of these synapses are relatively simple.
        </h5>
        <img src="./static/about/images/connection-area-and-position.png">
        <p>
            The centroid of the overlap is used to determine the x, y position of the synapse,<br>
            since the most likely place of connection is at the center of the synapse.
